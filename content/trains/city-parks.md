title: "Trains in City Parks Photographs"
theme: "cityparks"
filter_field: "source_collection"
description: "Railroad and transit imagery discovered in the City Parks Association Photographs collection -- Philadelphia's urban landscapes captured alongside their rail infrastructure."
clip_note: "CLIP visual analysis of all 1,189 photographs in the City Parks Association collection found 24 images containing train or railroad content. Of these, 7 overlapped with the 68 items identifiable through catalog metadata keywords. The remaining 17 were discovered by CLIP alone -- photographs where trains, tracks, or rail infrastructure appear in the scene but were not the cataloger's primary subject. Conversely, 61 metadata matches were not flagged by CLIP, typically because the keyword appeared in a description of location or context rather than in the visual content of the image."
