description: "Train and railroad imagery in Temple University's Allied Posters of World War I collection."
clip_note: "A CLIP (zero-shot image classification) scan of all 1,200 posters in the Allied Posters of World War I collection identified no additional train-related imagery beyond what was already discoverable through catalog metadata. The four posters below were found through keyword searches of titles, descriptions, and subject headings — confirming that trains were a minor visual motif in WWI propaganda, which focused primarily on bonds, recruitment, food conservation, and industrial labor."
